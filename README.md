# P2P-Stream-Delivery-Network
Computer Networks and the Internet - Project

Consists of sets of pairs that build and keep a tree network, built on the basis of TCP sessions established between them.
The tree is then used for the dissemination of a stream made available by a TCP server.
The server accepts a limited number of TCP sessions, which means that with high traffic the clients must connect to another clients and receive the content of the stream from them.
